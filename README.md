# Color Blindness Correction and Simulation

A desktop application developed in Python using OpenCV to simulate and correct color blindness in real-time.

## 📝 Description

This project provides real-time simulation and correction for various types of color blindness using a webcam feed. It aims to help users understand how individuals with color vision deficiencies perceive colors and offers correction filters to adjust the visuals accordingly.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time Simulation:** Simulates different types of color blindness.
- **Real-time Correction:** Applies filters to correct color vision for colorblind users.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple and intuitive controls.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python:** Programming language.
- **OpenCV:** Library for computer vision tasks.
- **NumPy:** Library for Mathematical equations in colors.
- **Tkinter:** Library to create Desktop App.
